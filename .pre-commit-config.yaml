#
# This is the configuration file of the pre-commit framework for this repository:
# https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit
#
# pre-commit runs in the GitHub Workflow of this project on each push and PR.
# Additionally, you can run it locally for faster fixing of issues using
# $ pip3 install pre-commit -r requirements-dev.txt
#
# On the initial run, pre-commit downloads its checkers, subsequent runs are fast:
#
# $ pre-commit run    # automatically checks which checks are needed.
# $ pre-commit run -a # runs all fixes and checks, even when not needed
#
# When this works, you can enable it as the pre-commit hook for this git clone:
# $ pre-commit install
# $ pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
#
# You can skip checks if you commit very often you don't want them to run, e.g:
# export SKIP=mypy,pylint;git commit -m "quick save" (or for --amend)
#
# For more customizations, see https://pre-commit.com/#temporarily-disabling-hooks
# and https://pre-commit.com/#confining-hooks-to-run-at-certain-stages (e.g push)
#
# After this, the pre-commit fixes and checks run when you commit an update.
#
# You can also automatically set pre-commit as pre-commit hook for new git clones:
# $ git config --global init.templateDir ~/.git-template
# $ pre-commit init-templatedir ~/.git-template
#
