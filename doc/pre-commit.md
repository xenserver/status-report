## Running CI checks locally (and in GitHub CI) using `pre-commit`

This project uses `pre-commit` to run the tests in a defined, clean environment:

- It fixes the code style of the tests with black and of `xen-bugtool` with darker
- It runs `pytest` with coverage and checks the coverage on the changed lines
- It runs `pylint`, `mypy`, `pyright` and `pytype`:

- https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/
- https://google.github.io/pytype/user_guide.html

- Because this project is now using Python3.6+, type annotations (PEP 484)
  no longer need to be in comments, but can be in the code directly.

  However, for compatibility with Python3.6 and type annotations like `list[str]`
  and `str | None` are not supported in Python3.6, so the older syntax
  `List[str]` and `Optional[str]` from the `typing` module have to be used,
  or continue to use type comments as before (described in PEP 484).
  See https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.List

To run all checks on all files, run:

```bash
uv pip install pre-commit
. .venv/bin/activate  # (if using a virtualenv)
pre-commit run -av
```
Without -a, it would only run hooks for staged files with changes.
With `-a`, `pre-commit run -a` runs all fixes and checks.

You can skip checks if you commit by passing `SKIP=` in the environment:
```py
export SKIP=mypy,pylint;git commit -m "quick save"  # (or for --amend)
```

Only the 1st invocation of pre-commit will be slow as it creates `virtualenv`s
for each sub-hook configured in its configuration file
[.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml). Subsequent runs are fast.

If a formatting hook like trailing-whitespace fails, just run `git add -p` to
stage the whitespace fixes into the index and run pre-commit again.
Or, if you already installed pre-commit as a git commit hook, commit again.

When you are ready to use pre-commit as a pre-commit hook in this clone,
run this command to install it. Until uninstalled from this repo, it will
then run on each commit. This is completely optional and just a matter of
preference:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Advanced: Run pre-commit hooks as part of `git rebase -i`

Ideally, if possible, pre-commit hooks should run on every commit to ensure that
each works without any errors, even when checking out an intermediary commit.
This is needed to allow for `git bisect` for finding commits causing breakage.

However, by default, `pre-commit` does not run during `git rebase` commands.
It checks only regular commits, not amends and not rebases.

`pre-commit` can be run during `git rebase` explicitly by using:
    git rebase -x 'pre-commit run --from-ref HEAD~ --to-ref HEAD' HEAD~1

Note: Replace the `1` with the number of commits to run the pre-commit hooks on.

When moving changes between commits while rebasing, they can get broken.

To fix these issues to make them clean for `git bisect` and make each
new commit in the stack work for itself, you can use a git alias:

```ml
[alias]
    prebase = rebase -x 'pre-commit run --from-ref HEAD~ --to-ref HEAD'
```
When using `git prebase -i` instead of `git rebase -i`, pre-commit will
run the configured commit hooks for each commit of the rebase.

This ensures that tests also pass on each intermediate commit.

When, during a `git prebase -i`, a pre-commit hook fails or makes changes,
the `rebase` stops, this is the workflow:
- You'll see the reason of the error and get a shell.
- You can then can check `git diff`, in case formatters fixed up the code.
- You can then fix any errors and stage them
- Then, run `git rebase --continue` to continue the rebase to the next step.
