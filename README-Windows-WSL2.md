## Recommendations for local Development on Windows and WSL2

### Using Docker on WSL2/22.04

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS uses `iptables-nft` by default.
Switch to `iptables-legacy` so that Docker will work:

### Copy selection on selecting test (without need for Ctrl-C)

On traditional X11 and KDE Plasma, selected text is automatically copied
to the X selection/clipboard for pasting it. To use this engrained behavior
on Windows as well, it seems the only reliable way to have it for all apps
is a `AutoHotKey` script:

While individual extensions for VS Code, Firefox, chrome do work partially,
they either don't cover the Firefox URL bar, the VS Code terminal and so on:
